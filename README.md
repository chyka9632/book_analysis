# What does this program do?


This program utilizes Python regular expressions to perform sentiment analysis. Using advanced pattern-matching techniques, it extracts valuable insights such as the most frequently used word, the total number of chapters, and the frequency of specific keywords. Additionally, it assesses the emotional tone of each chapter, categorizing them as positive or negative based on the language used. This comprehensive analysis provides a deeper understanding of the text's content and sentiment distribution.
